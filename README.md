Summary
The CoffeeShop app is a Java-based application with a MySQL database. It includes a frontend component for ordering coffee and backend components for processing orders and managing inventory.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Install Required Software
Java Development Kit (JDK):

Install the latest JDK from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
Visual Studio Code:

Download and install VSCode from the official website.
MySQL Database:

Install MySQL and create a database named "coffeeshop."
Step 2: Set Up Project in VSCode
Open VSCode:

Launch VSCode.
Install Extensions:

Install the "Java Extension Pack" by Microsoft for Java development support.
Install "Maven for Java" extension to support Maven projects.
Open Project Folder:

Create a new folder for your project.
Open VSCode and go to File > Open Folder, then select your project folder.
Create POM File:

Inside your project folder, create a file named pom.xml and add Maven dependencies.
Create Java Package:

Inside the src/main/java folder, create the package structure com/coffeeshop.
Create Java files (Coffee.java, Order.java, CoffeeDao.java, CoffeeService.java, DBUtil.java, CoffeeShopApp.java) inside the appropriate packages.
Create Resources Folder:

Inside your project folder, create a folder named resources.
Create a file named application.properties inside the resources folder.
Create Web Folder:

Inside your project folder, create a folder named web.
Create a file named index.html inside the web folder.
Step 3: Configure Database Connection
Configure application.properties:
Open the application.properties file in the resources folder.
Add the following properties:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/coffeeshop
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Step 4: Implement Application Logic
Implement Logic in CoffeeShopApp.java:
Complete the logic for user interaction in CoffeeShopApp.java. Use Scanner for simplicity.
Step 5: Run the Application
Run the Application:
Open the terminal in VSCode.
Navigate to your project folder.
Run the following command to compile and run the application:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
java -jar target/your_project_name.jar
Step 6: Create Frontend (Optional)
Implement HTML Form:

Open the index.html file in the web folder.
Create a simple HTML form for ordering coffee.
Run HTML File:

Use a simple web server to serve the HTML file. For example, install the "Live Server" extension in VSCode.
Step 7: Test the Application
Test the Application:
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (assuming your frontend is running on this port).
Test the ordering process and check if the data is stored in the database.
These steps provide a basic setup for a Java application in VSCode. For a more comprehensive, production-ready application, consider using Spring Boot for backend development and a dedicated frontend framework for better user interfaces.
